# 1.1 Introduction

## Purpose
The purpose of this test plan is to define the overall testing approach for the sample project.  
It ensures that testing activities are organized, traceable, and aligned with the projectâ€™s quality goals.

## Background
The project aims to deliver a software system that meets both functional and non-functional requirements.  
Testing will be conducted systematically to verify that the system behaves as expected and to identify any defects before release.

## Objectives
- Validate that the application meets specified requirements.  
- Detect and document defects in a controlled manner.  
- Ensure adequate coverage of in-scope features and explicitly exclude out-of-scope items.  
- Provide stakeholders with confidence in the quality, stability, and readiness of the product.
