> **Portfolio Note:** All manual test cases in this project are **simulation-based**.  
> No execution was performed on a live or demo banking system; scenarios are designed to demonstrate test analysis, design, and reporting skills.

## Assumptions
- Test scenarios model typical banking features (login, transfer, balance, etc.) for **simulation** purposes.
- Functional behaviors are assumed to work as specified in the scenario descriptions.
- Test data and credentials are **dummy** and used only for documentation purposes.

## Limitations
- **No real execution** was performed; all results shown in documentation are simulated.
- Third-party integrations (payment gateways, SMS) are not exercised.
- Performance, load, and security activities are documented conceptually only.
- Coverage focuses on functional positive/negative and common design techniques.
