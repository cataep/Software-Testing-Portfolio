# 1.8 Assumptions & Limitations

## Assumptions
- Test scenarios are based on the features available in the demo banking application (BankApp).  
- Functionalities simulated for portfolio purposes are assumed to behave as expected in a real system.  
- Test environment is stable enough to execute manual test cases without frequent interruptions.  
- User credentials and test data provided are valid only for testing purposes.  

## Limitations
- Some scenarios are simulated and not executed on a live banking system.  
- Integration with third-party systems (e.g., payment gateways, SMS services) is not tested in this portfolio.  
- Performance, load, and security testing are out of scope for manual test cases.  
- Test coverage is limited to functional positive and negative cases only.
