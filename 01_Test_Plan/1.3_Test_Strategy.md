# 1.3 Test Strategy

## Test Levels
- **Unit Testing**: Performed by developers to validate individual components.  
- **Integration Testing**: Ensures that modules interact correctly with each other.  
- **System Testing**: Verifies the complete functionality of the application as a whole.  
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Confirms the system meets business requirements and is ready for release.  

## Test Types
- **Functional Testing**: Validate business requirements and application workflows.  
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure existing functionality works after new changes.  
- **UI/UX Testing**: Check usability, layout consistency, and responsiveness.  
- **API Testing**: Validate request/response formats, error handling, and data integrity.  
- **Security Testing**: Authentication, authorization, and session management checks.  

## Test Approach
- Manual testing will be conducted for exploratory and regression scenarios.  
- Automated testing will be considered for repetitive regression tests in future iterations.  
- Defects will be logged and tracked using an issue management tool (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues).  

## Entry and Exit Criteria
**Entry Criteria:**  
- Requirements are defined and approved.  
- Test environment is set up and accessible.  
- Test cases are reviewed and ready.  

**Exit Criteria:**  
- All planned test cases are executed.  
- Critical defects are resolved or mitigated.  
- Test summary report is delivered and approved.
